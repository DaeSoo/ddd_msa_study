# 1. JHipster

## 1.1 JHipster?

```ssh
JHipster는 모던 웹 애플리케이션과 마이크로서비스 아키텍처를 빠르게 적용, 개발, 배포할 수 있도록 도와주는 오픈소스 개발 플랫폼
- Front-end : Angular, React, Vue,js
- Back-end  : Spring boot, Micronaut, Quarkus, Node.js, .NET
- Deploy    : Docker and Kubernetes for AWS, Azure, Cloud Foundary, GCP, Heroku, OpenShift
```

## 1.2 목적
```ssh
현대적인 웹 애플리케이션과 마이크로서비스 아키텍처를 생성하는데 있다.
- 광범위한 테스트를 커버할 수 있는 우수한 성능의 강력한 서버 스택
- 세련되고 현대적인 모바일 친화적 UI를 위한 Angular, React, Vue,js + BootStrap을 갖춘 CSS
- Webpack 및 Maven 또는 Gradle을 사용해 애플리케이션을 빌드하는 강력한 워크플로
- 클라우드에 빠르게 배포할 수 있는 코드 기반 인프라
```

## 1.3 JHipster 마이크로서비스 아키텍처
![Archetecture](./img/jhipster.png)
```ssh
- JHipster 레지스트리 : MSA 디스커버리 패턴의 구현, 다른 모든 요소를 서로 연결하고 서로 통신할 수 있게하는 역할을 한다. Eureka, Spring Cloud Config 기반으로 만들어진다.
- 마이크로서비스 : 백엔드 코드가 들어 있고, 실행 후 도메인에 대한 API를 노출한다. 여러 마이크로서비스로 구성될 수 있으며, 몇 개의 엔티티와 비즈니스 규칙이 포함된다.
- 게이트웨이 : 모든 Front-end 코드를 가지고 있으며, 전체 마이크로서비스에 생성한 API를 사용한다. Zuul Proxy, 리본을 사용한다.
- Back-end 소스코드 : src/main/java 폴더에 존재한다.
- Front-end 소스코드 : src/main/webapp 폴더에 존재하고, 앞에 선택한 기술로 만들어진다.
```

## 1.4 JHipster 환경 구축

- 현재 Mac OS를 사용 중이기 때문에 brew로 install
```ssh
$ brew install jhipster

Welcome to Gradle 8.4!

Here are the highlights of this release:
 - Compiling and testing with Java 21
 - Faster Java compilation on Windows
 - Role focused dependency configurations creation

For more details see https://docs.gradle.org/8.4/release-notes.html

Starting a Gradle Daemon (subsequent builds will be faster)

- 책과 화면이 다른대 제대로 된 건지 모르겠다.
- 그래서 기존에 microservice 에서 gateway로 변경 -> ? Which *type* of application would you like to create? Gateway application

![Gateway](./img/success_gateway.png)

- 해결(어이없게 삽질 ㅠ)
- 위의 선택 항목 변경을 해놔서 바로 적용이 가능
